# Football Project - Part 2
Created a part 2 of the football project, which is the continuous project from part 1 of the simple football project and using the same SQL and Python tools

Please click [Simple Football project](https://github.com/n1k35h/simple_football_project) to view the part 1 of the football project.

To carry on from part 1, in part 2 of this football project I have added the following attributes to the project:

- Added Total goals scored and total goals conceded to the league table.
